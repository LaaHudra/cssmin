= What is !CssMin? =

!CssMin is a css parser and minfier. It minifies css by removing unneeded whitespace character, comments, 
empty blocks and empty declarations. In addition declaration values can get rewritten to shorter notation if 
available. The minification is [Configuration configurable].

!CssMin has some benefits. It supports the rewrite of [MinifierFilterVariables CSS Level 3 properties to their browser 
specific counterparts] and is able to simulate [ConfigurationEmulateCss3Variables CSS Variables].
