= Whats new in Version 2.0 =

Version 2 is a complete rewrite of !CssMin. The minification is now seperated into [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization Tokenization] and Minification. 

The Tokenizer is written in plain PHP, requires no extensions, use no regular expressions and is optimized on savety and speed. On a decent machine 100KB complex css is tokenized in about 250 - 500ms.

The Minification is [Configuration configurable] and make limited use of regular expressions.
