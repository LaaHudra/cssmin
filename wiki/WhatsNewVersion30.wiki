= Whats new in Version 3.0 =

== OOP ==
!CssMin version 3 is a object orientated implementation of version 2. This fixes the major problem (at least for me) 
of version 2: the maintainability. Also version 3 should be less error-prone and has a much better expandability.

=== But there is always a price to pay ===
While the parser have the same speed as in version 2 the memory usage will be higher and the minification is ca. 20% 
slower (revision #92; with all configuration options turned on).

=== Fiters and plugins ===
The parser uses plugins to capsules the parsing logic for different tokens of a stylesheet and the minifier is using 
filters for pre-procession the array of tokens delivered by the parser and plugins for procession of single tokens.

=== Source and build version ===
The build version is a single file containing every php file of the source as minified version. The source version 
includes a autoload method that will get registered via [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php spl_autoload_register]

== Variables now can get used as part of a declaration value ==

{{{
@variables
	{
	/* Variable declaration */
	myVar: black;
	}
div.Test2
	{
	/* Variable used as part of a declaration value */
	border: 1px solid var(myVar);
	}
}}}

== Parser for expression() declaration values ==

expresssion() declaration values will get parsed property even if the expression includes curly braces and semicolons.
Additional if [https://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php/ JSMin] is defined the expression will get compressed using 
[https://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php/ JSMin].

== Formatters ==
For debugging purposes two formatter are included. The formatter will output a array of tokens with correct indentation
(and a optional declaration value padding). The formatters are:
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS OTBS (aka. 1TBS)] indent style
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Whitesmiths_style Whitesmiths] indent style
