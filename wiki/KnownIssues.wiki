== Comments between selector and ruleset and between declaration property and value ==

This will fail:
{{{
div
	/* Comment 1 */
	{
	border /* Comment 2 */: 1px solid black;
	}
}}}
Comments between selector and ruleset and between declaration property and value will get supported in version 2.0.2.

== Backslash escaped quote chars in string property ==

This will fail:
{{{
div
	{
	background-image: url(/images/my\"image.gif);
	}
}}}

Enclosing the string part of the property into quotes will work:
{{{
div
	{
	background-image: url("/images/my\"image.gif");
	}
}}}

== Multiple backslash escape chars following a escaped quote char ===

This will fail:
{{{
a[href~="contains\\\""]
	{
	...
	}
}}}

== Backslash escaped newline in strings ==

Won't fail but the LF will not get removed:

{{{
abbr:after
	{
	content: "string with a\
backslash escaped newline";
	}

}}}
