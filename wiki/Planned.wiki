== Better compatibility to CSS 2.1 4.2 Rules for handling parsing errors ==
See: [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#parsing-errors CSS 2.1 4.2 Rules for handling parsing errors]

== Error reporting ==
Parse errors should be reported in some unobtrusive way.

== Compress 2 matching pairs of horizontal and vertical units to 1 pair ==
Declarations like `padding: 2px 5px 2px 5px;` should get compressed to `padding: 2px 5px;`.

== !important ==
The Tokenization should recognize the !important flag and extend the T_DECLARATIONS token.
